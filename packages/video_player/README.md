# video_player_tizen

The Tizen implementation of [`video_player`](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/video_player).

## Required privileges

To use this plugin in a Tizen application, the mediastorage, externalstorage and internet privileges are required. Add below lines under the `<manifest>` section in your `tizen-manifest.xml` file.

```xml
<privileges>
  <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/mediastorage</privilege>
  <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/externalstorage</privilege>
  <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/internet</privilege>
</privileges>
```

- The mediastorage privilege (`http://tizen.org/privilege/mediastorage`) must be added to play video files located in the internal storage.
- The externalstorage privilege (`http://tizen.org/privilege/externalstorage`) must be added to play video files located in the external storage.
- The internet privilege (`http://tizen.org/privilege/internet`) must be added to play any URLs from network.

For details, see [Security and API Privileges](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/tutorials/sec-privileges).

## Usage

This package is not an _endorsed_ implementation of `video_player`. Therefore, you have to include `video_player_tizen` alongside `video_player` as dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  video_player: ^2.1.0
  video_player_tizen: ^1.0.0
```

Then you can import `video_player` in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:video_player/video_player.dart';
```

For how to use the plugin, see https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/video_player/video_player#usage.

## Limitations

The 'httpheaders' option for 'VideoPlayerController.network' and 'mixWithOthers' option of 'VideoPlayerOptions' will be silently ignored in Tizen platform.

This plugin has some limitations on TV:

- Don't change playback speed at last 3 senconds when playing video, otherwise it will be failed.
- If playing a video in a loop and change the playback speed(not 1.0) successfully, the playback speed will be recovered to 1.0 when play video again.
- Don't use seekTo if playback speed isn't 1.0, seekTo doesn't work after change playback speed.
- The video has some key frames, seekTo will set position to the key frame. For example, the video has key frame on 0 second and 3 second, actually the position is at 3 second when seek the position to 2 second.
