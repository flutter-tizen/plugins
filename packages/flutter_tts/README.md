# flutter_tts_tizen

The tizen implementation of [`flutter_tts`](https://github.com/dlutton/flutter_tts).

## Getting Started

This package is not an _endorsed_ implementation of `flutter_tts`. Therefore, you have to include `flutter_tts_tizen` alongside `flutter_tts` as dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_tts: ^3.0.0
  flutter_tts_tizen: ^1.1.1
```

Then you can import `flutter_tts` in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_tts/flutter_tts.dart';
```
