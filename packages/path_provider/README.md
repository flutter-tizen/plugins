# path_provider_tizen

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/path_provider_tizen.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider_tizen)

The Tizen implementation of [`path_provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider).

## Usage

This package is not an _endorsed_ implementation of `path_provider`. Therefore, you have to include `path_provider_tizen` alongside `path_provider` as dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  path_provider: ^2.0.7
  path_provider_tizen: ^2.1.0
```

Then you can import `path_provider` in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
```

For detailed usage, see https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider#usage.
