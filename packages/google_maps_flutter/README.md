## Required privileges

To use this plugin, add below lines under the `<manifest>` section in your `tizen-manifest.xml` file.

```xml
<privileges>
  <privilege>http://tizen.org/privilege/internet</privilege>
</privileges>

## Usage

This package is not an _endorsed_ implementation of `google_maps_flutter`. Therefore, you have to include `google_maps_flutter_tizen` alongside `google_maps_flutter` as dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  google_maps_flutter: ^2.10.0
  google_maps_flutter_tizen: ^0.1.12
```

For detailed usage, see https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter#sample-usage.

In addition, you need a Maps JavaScript API Key to use this plugin. You can get an API key at [this page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and specify it in the `assets/map.html` file of your app.

```js
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY">
```

Plus, to use MarkerClusterer, you need to include the following script in the `assets/map.html` file
```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@googlemaps/markerclusterer/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

## Limitations

- This plugin was implemented using the [Google JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview).
- The Marker feature uses the [Legacy API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers). Depending on the Deprecate plan of the JavaScript API, some parts may not work.
- [Heatmap layers](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter_platform_interface/changelog#290) and tile overlays are not yet supported.
