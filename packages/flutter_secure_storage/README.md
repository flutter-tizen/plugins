[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_secure_storage_tizen.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage_tizen)

The Tizen implementation of [`flutter_secure_storage`](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage).

## Getting Started

This package is not an _endorsed_ implementation of `flutter_secure_storage`. Therefore, you have to include `flutter_secure_storage_tizen` alongside `flutter_secure_storage` as dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_secure_storage: ^6.0.0
  flutter_secure_storage_tizen: ^0.1.0
```

Then you can import `flutter_secure_storage` in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';
```

For detailed usage, see https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage#usage.
