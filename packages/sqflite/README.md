The Tizen implementation of [`sqflite`](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite).

## Getting Started

This package is not an _endorsed_ implementation of `sqflite`. Therefore, you have to include `sqflite_tizen` alongside `sqflite` as dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  sqflite: ^2.2.8
  sqflite_tizen: ^0.1.2
```

Then you can import `sqflite` in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
```

For detailed usage, see https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite#usage-example.
